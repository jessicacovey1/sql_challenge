This is my homework on PostgreSQL.  

We are importing csv files, creating tables and making relationships between tables.

We used primary keys and foreign keys to make relationships.

Some tables serve as junction tables to bridge other tables together.

I found assigning the keys was harder than I thought it would be.

I didn't like that I had to keep importing over and over when I found I didn't build my tables right.

This gives me a better understanding for how my electronic database system at work is structured.
